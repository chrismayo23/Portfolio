        I am a full stack software engineer who specializes in front end development with Angular. I use the framework
        and
        design methods to build web sites to provide quality user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on Angular projects for T-Mobile (telecommunication sytem management), Comcast (cable system management), KPMG (tax service), and Site 1001 (facility maintenance start-up). 
        My work shows analysis and understanding of business objectives to create great projects and web sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also created some sample projects in my portfolio to show my expertise in Angular, React,
        Node, and database systems such as SQL and noSQL.
